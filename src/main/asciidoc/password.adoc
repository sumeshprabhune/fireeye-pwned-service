= Fireeye Pwned Password Service Documentation

This is the documentation of the service running at http://localhost:8080/pwned

Pwned Passwords are more than half a billion passwords which have previously been exposed in data breaches.
Each password is stored as a SHA-1 hash of a UTF-8 encoded password. The downloadable source data delimits the full SHA-1 hash and the password count with a colon (:) and each line with a CRLF.

The documentation is heavily derived from the original Pwned website https://haveibeenpwned.com

== Searching by range

In order to protect the value of the source password being searched for, Pwned Passwords also implements a k-Anonymity model that allows a password to be searched for by partial hash. This allows the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 password hash (not case-sensitive) to be passed to the API.

== Password Sample Response

When a password hash with the same first 5 characters is found in the Pwned Passwords repository, the API will respond with an HTTP 200 and include the suffix of every hash beginning with the specified prefix, followed by a count of how many times it appears in the data set. The API consumer can then search the results of the response for the presence of their source hash and if not found, the password does not exist in the data set.

A sample response for the hash prefix "ABCDE" would be as follows:
