= Fireeye Pwned Service Documentation

Welcome to FireEye Pwned Service documentation.
Please read through to understand the various endpoints supported.

= Breach Service
This is the documentation of the service running at http://localhost:8080/pwned
It retrieves breaches by varying combinations.
The documentation is heavily derived from the original Pwned website https://haveibeenpwned.com

== Getting all breaches for an account

The most common use of the API is to return a list of all breaches a particular account has been involved in. The API takes a single parameter which is the account to be searched for. The account is not case sensitive and will be trimmed of leading or trailing white spaces. The account should always be URL encoded.

.Sample Request
include::{snippets}/account-breach/http-request.adoc[]

Following are option request parameters that endpoint allows to modify the response

.Path Parameters

.Request Parameters

== Getting all breach sites in Pwned

A "breach" is an instance of a system having been compromised by an attacker and the data disclosed. For example, Adobe was a breach, Gawker was a breach etc. It is possible to return the details of each of breach in the system which currently stands at 365 breaches.

.Sample Request
include::{snippets}/all-breach/http-request.adoc[]

== Getting a single breached site

Sometimes just a single breach is required and this can be retrieved by the breach "name". This is the stable value which may or may not be the same as the breach "title" (which can change). See the breach model below for more info.

.Sample Request
include::{snippets}/name-breach/http-request.adoc[]

.Path Parameters

== Sample Breach Response

== Getting all data classes in the system

A "data class" is an attribute of a record compromised in a breach. For example, many breaches expose data classes such as "Email addresses" and "Passwords". The values returned by this service are ordered alphabetically in a string array and will expand over time as new breaches expose previously unseen classes of data.

= Paste Service

This is the documentation of the service running at http://localhost:8080/pwned
The documentation is heavily derived from the original Pwned website https://haveibeenpwned.com

== Getting all pastes for an account

The API takes a single parameter which is the email address to be searched for. Unlike searching for breaches, usernames that are not email addresses cannot be searched for. The email is not case sensitive and will be trimmed of leading or trailing white spaces. The email should always be URL encoded.

.Sample Request

= Password Service

This is the documentation of the service running at http://localhost:8080/pwned

Pwned Passwords are more than half a billion passwords which have previously been exposed in data breaches.
Each password is stored as a SHA-1 hash of a UTF-8 encoded password. The downloadable source data delimits the full SHA-1 hash and the password count with a colon (:) and each line with a CRLF.

The documentation is heavily derived from the original Pwned website https://haveibeenpwned.com

== Searching by range

In order to protect the value of the source password being searched for, Pwned Passwords also implements a k-Anonymity model that allows a password to be searched for by partial hash. This allows the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 password hash (not case-sensitive) to be passed to the API.

.Sample Request

include::{snippets}/password/http-request.adoc[]

. Request Path Parameters

include::{snippets}/password/path-parameters.adoc[]


== Password Sample Response

When a password hash with the same first 5 characters is found in the Pwned Passwords repository, the API will respond with an HTTP 200 and include the suffix of every hash beginning with the specified prefix, followed by a count of how many times it appears in the data set. The API consumer can then search the results of the response for the presence of their source hash and if not found, the password does not exist in the data set.

A sample response for the hash prefix "ABCDE" would be as follows:
